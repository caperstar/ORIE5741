# Project Description
Balancing risk and profit is an eternal topic for firms, especially for the financial firms that live on loan interests from the credible customers. Correspondingly, it is necessary to have a comprehensive and fair evaluation of the applicants on whether they should get credits. Hereby, we propose to establish a series of machine learning models to score the credits of each applicant based on their historical data such as demographic information, previous financial records, current financial status etc..
